    s3: add multi-part-upload support for If-Match and If-None-Match
    
    #8947 implemented support for the If-Match and If-None-Match headers for S3 PUT
    Object requests; however, this support did not extend to multi-part copy and
    upload requests. These headers are implemented via inclusion in the
    CompleteMultipartUpload request.
    
    This updates the auto generated code also which was needed for multipart copy.

    rc: config/unlock: rename parameter to `configPassword` accept old as well
    
    We accidentally added a non `camelCase` parameter to the rc
    (`config_password`)- this fixes it (to `configPassword`) but accepts
    the old name too as it has been in a release.

    rc: correct names of parameters in job/list output
    
    These were accidentally committed as snake_case whereas we use
    camelCase elsewhere.
    
    This corrects the issue before the first release in v1.72.0

    box: allow to configure with config file contents
    
    Especially when using rclone via rc it is helpful to configure the box
    backend using the contents of the config file instead of heaving to
    upload the file to the server that is running rclone.

    build: fix tls: failed to verify certificate: x509: negative serial number
    
    Before Go 1.23, x509.ParseCertificate accepted certificates with
    negative serial numbers. Rejecting these certificates caused a small
    number of users to see this error.
    
    From Go 1.23 debug flags can be added to go.mod so this change adds a
    debug flag to ensure negative serial numbers are still allowed since
    this is a spec violation, not a security issue.

    make requests conditional which allow AWS S3 Bucket Policies to

    rc: make sure fatal errors don't crash rclone - fixes #8955
    
    Before this change, if any code called fs.Fatal(f) then it would stop
    rclone as designed. However this is not appropriate when using the RC
    API - we want the error returned to the user.
    
    This change turns the fs.Fatal(f) call into a panic which is caught by
    the RC API handler and returned to the user as a 500 error.

    ulozto: Fix downloads returning HTML error page
    
    The uloz.to backend was failing to download files, instead returning
    an HTML page with a "Slow download" message. This was caused by
    recent changes in the uloz.to API.
    
    This commit fixes the issue by making the following changes to the
    download process:
    
    1.  The `hash` received from the download link API is now appended as a
        query parameter to the download URL.
    2.  The download is now performed using the authenticated `rest` client
        to ensure premium access is recognized.
    3.  The `DeviceID` is now generated dynamically for each download request
        to avoid potential rate-limiting of a static ID.

    build: improve backend docs autogenerated marker line
    
    Replace custom rem hugo shortcode template with HTML comment. HTML comments are now
    allowed in Hugo without enabling unsafe HTML parsing.
    
    Improve the text in the comment: Remove unnecessary quoting, and avoid impression that
    make backenddocs has to be run and results committed, since we have a lint check which
    will then report error because we want to prevent manual changes in autogenerated sections.
    
    Disable the markdownlint rule line-length on the autogenerated marker line.
    
    Make the autogenerated marker detection a bit more robust.
    
    See #8942 for more details.

    sftp: fix zombie SSH processes with --sftp-ssh - Fixes #8929
    
    Before this fix using --sftp-ssh with the sftp backend could leave
    zombie processes.
    
    This patch fixes the problem that sshClientExternal.session was never
    assigned, so Wait() always returned nil without waiting for the SSH
    process to exit. This caused zombie processes because the process was
    never reaped.
    
    It also ensures that Wait() is only called once on each process.
    
    I gave this issue to Copilot to fix as an experiment. It went off in
    the wrong direction to start with and fixed something which wasn't the
    problem but still needed fixing. With a bit of a nudge it fixed the
    correct problem too.

    testserver: fix tests failing due to stopped servers
    
    Before this fix there were various issues with the test server
    framework, most noticeably servers stopping when they shouldn't
    causing timeouts. This was caused by the reference counting in the Go
    code not being engineered to work in multiple processes so it was not
    working at all properly.
    
    This fix moves the reference counting logic to the start scripts and
    in turn removes that logic from the Go code. This means that the
    reference counting is now global and works correctly over multiple
    processes.

    bisync: fix failing tests
    
    In this commit
    
    d240d044c35021d2 check: improved reporting of differences in sizes and contents
    
    We adjusted the sense of operations.CheckIdenticalDownload to return
    true if files are identical as is implied by the name, but we forgot
    to invert the logic in the bisync DownloadCheckFn which caused lots of
    tests to fail.

    b2: Add Server-Side encryption support
    
    This commit adds SSE-C (Server-Side Encryption - Customer) support to
    the B2 native backend. The server uses a customer provided AES-256 key
    to encrypt the files when you upload them to the bucket, and then it
    discards your key from the servers RAM after you're done uploading.
    
    The option names and descriptions are based off the S3 backend
    implementation as the way S3 and B2 does SSE-C is pretty similar.
    
    Fixes #6585

    fs: remove unnecessary Seek call on log file
    
    We were seeing a (non-fatal) error in our logs:
    ```
    Failed to seek log file to end: seek /proc/1/fd/1: illegal seek
    ```
    
    Because we open the log file with O_APPEND,
    we don't need to manually seek to the end.
    As https://pkg.go.dev/os#File.Seek also confirms
    that the behavior of `Seek` is not specified
    if the file has been opened with O_APPEND,
    remove the `Seek` call.

    s3: make it easier to add new S3 providers
    
    Before this change, you had to modify a fragile data-structure
    containing all providers. This often led to things being out of order,
    duplicates and conflicts whilst merging. As well as the changes for
    one provider being in different places across the file.
    
    After this change, new providers are defined in an easy to edit YAML file,
    one per provider.
    
    The config output has been tested before and after for all providers
    and any changes are cosmetic only.

    march: fix --no-traverse being very slow - fixes #8860
    
    Before this change --no-traverse was calling NewObject on directories
    (where it would always fail) as well as files. This was very
    noticeable when doing syncs with --max-age which were only
    transferring a small number of objects. This should have been very
    quick, but the NewObject calls for each directory slowed the sync down
    a lot.
    
    This changes replaces the check to see if the source entry is an
    Object that got missed out from this commit:

    jottacloud: added support for traditional oauth authentication also for the main service
    
    This renames whitelabel authentication to traditional authentication and adds support for
    the main Jottacloud service also here, as it can be used as an alternative to the
    authentication based on personal login token for those who prefer it. Documentation
    also adjusted correspondingly, and restructured the authentication section a bit more
    since some of the sections that was under standard authentication in reality also
    applies to the traditional authentication.

    jottacloud: improved token refresh handling
    
    The oauthutil.Renew was initialized early in NewFs, before the first request to the
    service where a token is needed. When token is already expired at the time NewFs is
    called, the Renew operation would be triggered immediately, only to abort before actually
    performing a token refresh, for reason described in debug message:
    
        Token expired but no uploads in progress - doing nothing
    
    Then later in NewFs, a request to the customer endpoint was made, and since it requires
    a valid token it would perform a token refresh after all.
    
    This was not a big problem, but a bit unnecessary, and the debug log messages made it
    confusing to understand what rclone was actually doing regarding token refreshing.
    
    If, from debugger, we were forcing the Renew operation to perform actual token refresh,
    even if no uploads in process, then it would fail because it actually needs the username
    which is retrieved from the customer endpoint
    
        jottacloud root '': Token refresh failed: read metadata failed: error 400: org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UsernameNotFoundException: Username not found in url! (Bad Request)
    
    Don't think this can happen in any real situations, but better to make sure it never can.

    build: Bump SwiftAIO container to a newer one
    
    The bouncestorage image hasn't been updated for 4 years and has this
    message at the top of the docs:
    
      This repository is outdated; please use dockerswiftaio/docker-swift instead.
    
    However, dockerswiftaio/docker-swift hasn't been updated for 2 years.
    Switch to openstackswift/saio instead, which is getting regular updates.
    
    This requires some minor changes to one test, and how we start the
    container.

    build: Retry stopping the test server
    
    On my system there needs to be a slight pause between stopping and
    checking to see if SwiftAIO has stopped. Without the pause the tests fail for
    a non-obvious reason.
    
    Instead of using a magic sleep, re-use the retry logic that is used for
    starting the test server.

    jottacloud: fix authentication for whitelabel services from Elkjøp subsidiaries
    
    This adds support for them in the whitelabel autentication type, relying on OpenID
    Connect, same as Telia, Tele2 etc already uses.
    
    Until recently the Elkjøp subsidiaries still supported the legacy authentication type
    only, but that seem to have changed. They no longer support legacy authentication, which
    made existing rclone version incompatible with them.
    
    With this the legacy authentication has no known uses, however the implementation of

    accounting: add SetMaxCompletedTransfers method to fix bisync race #8815
    
    Before this change bisync adjusted the global MaxCompletedTransfers
    variable which caused races.
    
    This adds a SetMaxCompletedTransfers method and uses it in bisync.
    
    The MaxCompletedTransfers global becomes the default. This can be
    changed externally if rclone is in use as a library, and the commit
    history indicates that MaxCompletedTransfers was added for exactly
    this purpose so we try not to break it here.

    Before this change bisync was adjusting MaxCompletedTransfers in order

    This wasn't working (because it was only clearing one transfer) and
    was part of a race adjusting MaxCompletedTransfers.
    
    This fixes the problem by introducing a new method RemoveDoneTransfers
    to clear the done transfers explicitly and calling it in bisync.

    pacer: fix deadlock with --max-connections
    
    If the pacer was used recursively and --max-connections was in use
    then it could deadlock if all the connections were in use at the time
    of recursive call (likely).
    
    This affected the azureblob backend because when it receives an
    InvalidBlockOrBlob error it attempts to clear the condition before
    retrying. This in turn involves recursively calling the pacer.
    
    This fixes the problem by skipping the --max-connections check if the
    pacer is called recursively.
    
    The recursive detection is done by stack inspection which isn't ideal,
    but the alternative would be to add ctx to all >1,000 pacer calls. The
    benchmark reveals stack inspection takes about 55nS per stack level so
    it is relatively cheap.

    pikpak: fix unnecessary retries by using URL expire parameter - fixes #8601
    
    Before this change, rclone would unnecessarily retry downloads when
    the `Link.Expire` field was unreliable but the download URL contained
    a valid expire query parameter. This primarily affects cases where
    media links are unavailable or when `no_media_link` is enabled.
    
    The `Link.Valid()` method now primarily checks the URL's expire query
    parameter (as Unix timestamp) and falls back to the Expire field
    only when URL parsing fails. This eliminates the `error no link`
    retry loops while maintaining backward compatibility.

    lib/pool: fix unreliable TestPoolMaxBufferMemory test
    
    This turned out to be a problem in the tests. The tests used to do
    
    1. allocate
    2. increment
    3. free
    4. decrement
    
    But if one goroutine had just completed 2 and another had just
    completed 3 then this can cause the test to register too many
    allocations.
    
    This was fixed by doing the test in this order instead:
    
    1. allocate
    2. increment
    3. decrement
    4. free
    
    The 4 operations are atomic.

    local: fix rmdir "Access is denied" on windows - fixes #8363
    
    Before this change, Rmdir (and other commands that rely on Rmdir) would fail
    with "Access is denied" on Windows, if the directory had
    FILE_ATTRIBUTE_READONLY. This could happen if, for example, an empty folder had
    a custom icon added via Windows Explorer's interface (Properties => Customize =>
    Change Icon...).
    
    However, Microsoft docs indicate that "This attribute is not honored on
    directories."
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/file-attribute-constants#file_attribute_readonly
    Accordingly, this created an odd situation where such directories were removable
    (by their owner) via File Explorer and the rd command, but not via rclone.
    
    An upstream issue has been open since 2018, but has not yet resulted in a fix.
    https://github.com/golang/go/issues/26295
    
    This change gets around the issue by doing os.Chmod on the dir and then retrying
    os.Remove. If the dir is not empty, this will still fail with "The directory is
    not empty."
    
    A bisync user confirmed that it fixed their issue in
    https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-leaving-empty-directories-on-unc-path-1-or-local-filesystem-path-2-on-directory-renames/52456/4?u=nielash
    
    It is likely also a fix for #8019, although @ncw is correct that Purge would be
    a more efficient solution in that particular scenario.

    bisync: fix error handling for renamed conflicts
    
    Before this change, rclone could crash during modifyListing if a rename's
    srcNewName is known but not found in the srcList
    (srcNewName != "" && new == nil).
    This scenario should not happen, but if it does, we should print an error
    instead of crashing.
    
    On #8458 there is a report of this possibly happening on v1.68.2. It is unknown
    what the underlying issue was, and whether it still exists in the latest
    version, but if it does, the user will now see an error and debug info instead
    of a crash.

    c63f1865f36058e1 operations: copy: generate stable partial suffix
    
    We made the partial suffix for non inplace copies stable. This was a
    hash based off the file fingerprint.
    
    However, given a directory of files which have the same fingerprint
    the partial suffix collides. On some backends (eg the local backend)
    the fingerprint is just the size and modification time so files with
    different contents can collide.
    
    The effect of collisions was hash failures on copy when using
    --transfers > 1. These copies invariably retried successfully which
    probably explains why this bug hasn't been reported.
    
    This fixes the problem by adding the file name to the hash.
    
    It also makes sure the hash is always represented as 8 hex bytes for
    consistency.

    bisync: fix chunker integration tests
    
    Before this change, TestChunkerS3: tests were failing because our use of
    obj.Remove (for "modtime_write_test") created an unexpected extra transfer.
    
    This is because chunker calls operations.Move for removes, which (per its
    function comment) is supposed to be only accounted as a check. But because S3
    can Copy but not Move, the move falls back to copy and ends up getting counted
    as a transfer anyway.
    https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/99e8a63df2528e4fd470821095cbeb32e8a827a3/fs/operations/operations.go#L506

    This is probably a bug that should get a more proper fix in operations. But in
    the meantime, we can get around it by doing our "modtime_write_test" with its
    own unique stats group.

    bisync: fix koofr integration tests
    
    Before this change, koofr failed certain bisync tests because it can't set mod
    time without deleting and re-uploading. This caused the "nothing to transfer" log
    to not get printed where expected (as it is only printed when there are 0
    transfers, but koofr requires extra transfers to set modtime.)
    
    This change fixes the issue by ignoring the absence of the "nothing to transfer"
    log line on backends that return `fs.ErrorCantSetModTimeWithoutDelete` for
    `obj.SetModTime`.

    bisync: ignore expected "nothing to transfer" differences on tests
    
    The "There was nothing to transfer" log is only printed when the number of
    transfers is exactly 0. However, there are a variety of reasons why the transfer
    count would be expected to differ between backends. For example, if either side
    lacks hashes, the sync may in fact need to transfer, where it would otherwise
    skip based on hash or just update modtime. Transfer stats will also differ in
    the "src and dst identical but can't set mod time without deleting and re-
    uploading" scenario (because the re-upload is a transfer), and where --download-hash
    is needed (because calculating the hash requires downloading the file, which is
    a transfer).
    
    Before this change, these expected differences would result in erroneous test
    failures. This change fixes the issue by ignoring the absence of the "nothing to
    transfer" log where it is expected.
    
    Note that this issue did not occur before
    https://github.com/rclone/rclone/commit/9e200531b1490000656031c42fff4d95477e1b46
    because the number of transfers was not getting reset between test steps,
    sometimes resulting in an artificially inflated transfers count.

    change fixes it by skipping in this scenario.

    As of
    https://github.com/rclone/rclone/commit/4280ec75ccfd27fbc4f646d5323b8ed060062be5
    the lib/transform docs are generated with //go:generate and embedded with
    //go:embed.
    
    Before this change, however, they were not getting automatically updated with
    subsequent changes (like
    https://github.com/rclone/rclone/commit/fe62a2bb4ea8f62a1567c7883c0bba81827656eb)
    because `go generate ./lib/transform` was not being run as part of the release
    making process.
    
    This change fixes that by running it in `make commanddocs`.

    vfs: fix SIGHUP killing serve instead of flushing directory caches
    
    Before, rclone serve would crash when sent a SIGHUP which contradicts
    the documentation - saying it should flush the directory caches.
    
    Moved signal handling from the mount into the vfs layer, which now
    handles SIGHUP on all uses of the VFS including mount and serve.
    
    Fixes #8607
