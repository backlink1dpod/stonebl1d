## How to Maximize Your No Deposit Bonuses

Winning with a no deposit bonus requires understanding volatility and wagering requirements (WR), not just luck.

To turn these free credits into withdrawable cash, follow these expert steps:

**Check the WR:** Most bonuses come with a 30x or 40x rollover. Calculate exactly how much you need to wager before the funds unlock.

**Play Low Volatility Pokies:** Games that pay out small amounts frequently help you meet wagering requirements faster than high-volatility jackpot slots.

**Verify Identity Early:** Don't wait until you win to upload your ID. KYC (Know Your Customer) checks can delay withdrawals, so get them done immediately upon registration.
